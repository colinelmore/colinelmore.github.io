            <h5>Squats</h5>
             <p>
                During squats, multiple key muscle groups come into play, including the quadriceps, 
                responsible for knee extension, the gluteus maximus powering hip extension, and the hamstrings 
                providing assistance. Additionally, the lower back muscles maintain spinal stability, and the calf
                muscles stabilize the ankles. Squats offer a wide range of benefits, such as building lower body 
                strength and muscle mass, improving functional strength for daily activities and sports, enhancing 
                posture and balance, and increasing flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles. They also help burn calories, 
                support weight management, boost overall athleticism, and reduce the risk of injury by strengthening the muscles
                and joints involved in the movement.

                <h5>Romanian Deadlift</h5>
                 <p>
                    Romanian deadlifts, often abbreviated as RDLs, are a popular strength training exercise that primarily 
                    targets the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back muscles. Unlike conventional deadlifts, which start from 
                    the ground, Romanian deadlifts begin from a standing position, and the lifter lowers the barbell or dumbbells 
                    down the front of their legs while maintaining a slight knee bend and a straight back. This exercise is renowned 
                    for its effectiveness in building posterior chain strength and enhancing hip flexibility. Incorporating Romanian 
                    deadlifts into your workout routine can help improve your overall strength and posture while reducing the risk of 
                    lower back injuries.

                    <h5>Deadlift</h5>
                     <p>
                        Deadlifts are a fundamental strength training exercise where you lift a barbell or heavy object 
                        from the ground to a standing position. This compound movement engages numerous muscle groups, 
                        enhancing overall strength, grip, core stability, and back of leg muscles. Deadlifts are a cornerstone of strength 
                        and conditioning programs, benefiting posture, muscle growth, and functional strength. Proper 
                        form is essential to prevent injuries and maximize results.

                            The reverse lunge is a lower body exercise in which you step backward with one leg, 
                            lowering your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. This movement targets 
                            the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes while also improving balance and stability. Reverse 
                            lunges are a versatile exercise that can be performed with body weight or additional resistance,
                             making them a valuable addition to leg and lower body workouts.

                             <p>
                                Leg extensions are a common isolation exercise performed on a leg extension machine at the gym. 
                                This exercise primarily targets the quadriceps muscles in the front of the thigh. During a leg 
                                extension, you sit on the machine with your knees bent at 90 degrees and extend your legs to lift 
                                the weight by straightening your knees. Leg extensions are effective for developing and isolating 
                                the quadriceps but should be performed with proper form to minimize the risk of injury, especially 
                                to the knees. They are often included in leg workouts to improve quad strength and definition.

                                    Calf raises are a simple yet effective exercise for strengthening the calf muscles, 
                                    located in the back of the lower leg. They are commonly done by standing with your 
                                    feet flat on the ground and then lifting your heels off the floor, going up on your 
                                    toes. You can perform calf raises with both feet simultaneously or with one foot at a 
                                    time for added balance and stability. This exercise is valuable for improving calf strength
                                     and stability, which can be beneficial for various activities, including walking, running, 
                                     and sports that require powerful lower leg muscles.
