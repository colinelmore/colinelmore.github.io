        "name": "Squats",
        "description": "During squats, multiple key muscle groups come into play, including the quadriceps, responsible for knee extension, the gluteus maximus powering hip extension, and the hamstrings providing assistance. Additionally, the lower back muscles maintain spinal stability, and the calfmuscles stabilize the ankles. Squats offer a wide range of benefits, such as building lower body strength and muscle mass, improving functional strength for daily activities and sports, enhancing posture and balance, and increasing flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles. They also help burn calories, support weight management, boost overall athleticism, and reduce the risk of injury by strengthening the musclesand joints involved in the movement.",

        "description": "Romanian deadlifts, often abbreviated as RDLs, are a popular strength training exercise that primarily targets the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back muscles. Unlike conventional deadlifts, which start from the ground, Romanian deadlifts begin from a standing position, and the lifter lowers the barbell or dumbbells down the front of their legs while maintaining a slight knee bend and a straight back. This exercise is renowned for its effectiveness in building posterior chain strength and enhancing hip flexibility. Incorporating Romanian deadlifts into your workout routine can help improve your overall strength and posture while reducing the risk of lower back injuries.",
