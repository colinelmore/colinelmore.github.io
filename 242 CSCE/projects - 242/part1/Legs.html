            <h5>Squats</h5>
             <p>
                During squats, multiple key muscle groups come into play, including the quadriceps, 
                responsible for knee extension, the gluteus maximus powering hip extension, and the hamstrings 
                providing assistance. Additionally, the lower back muscles maintain spinal stability, and the calf
                muscles stabilize the ankles. Squats offer a wide range of benefits, such as building lower body 
                strength and muscle mass, improving functional strength for daily activities and sports, enhancing 
                posture and balance, and increasing flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles. They also help burn calories, 
                support weight management, boost overall athleticism, and reduce the risk of injury by strengthening the muscles
                and joints involved in the movement.
