            <h5>Sit-ups</h5>
             <p>
                Sit-ups primarily engage the rectus abdominis, the front abdominal muscles, and the hip flexors. 
                As you lift your upper body towards your knees, these muscles contract to perform the movement. 
                Sit-ups are effective for strengthening the core muscles and improving abdominal endurance. 
                They also contribute to better posture and can help tone and define the abdominal area when incorporated into 
                a well-rounded fitness routine.
