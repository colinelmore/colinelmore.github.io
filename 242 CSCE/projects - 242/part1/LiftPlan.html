                <h5>Squats</h5>
                 <p>
                    During squats, multiple key muscle groups come into play, including the quadriceps, 
                    responsible for knee extension, the gluteus maximus powering hip extension, and the hamstrings 
                    providing assistance. Additionally, the lower back muscles maintain spinal stability, and the calf
                    muscles stabilize the ankles. Squats offer a wide range of benefits, such as building lower body 
                    strength and muscle mass, improving functional strength for daily activities and sports, enhancing 
                    posture and balance, and increasing flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles. They also help burn calories, 
                    support weight management, boost overall athleticism, and reduce the risk of injury by strengthening the muscles
                    and joints involved in the movement.

                    <h5>Sit-ups</h5>
                    <p>
                       Sit-ups primarily engage the rectus abdominis, the front abdominal muscles, and the hip flexors. 
                       As you lift your upper body towards your knees, these muscles contract to perform the movement. 
                       Sit-ups are effective for strengthening the core muscles and improving abdominal endurance. 
                       They also contribute to better posture and can help tone and define the abdominal area when incorporated into 
                       a well-rounded fitness routine.

                        <h5>Bench Press</h5>
             <p>
                During a bench press, the primary muscles at work are the pectoralis major (chest muscles), 
                with support from the anterior deltoids and triceps. The upper back muscles also assist in maintaining proper posture. 
                Bench presses are excellent for building chest strength, shoulder stability, and overall upper body muscle development, 
                making them a fundamental exercise in strength training.

                            <h5>Lat-Pulldowns</h5>
                 <p>
                    During lat pull-downs, the latissimus dorsi muscles, commonly known as the lats, are the primary muscles 
                    engaged. These large muscles in the upper back are responsible for the pulling motion as you lower the bar 
                    or handle towards your chest. Additionally, the muscles of the shoulders, including the rear deltoids and 
                    trapezius, assist in the movement, providing stability and support. The biceps also contribute to the pulling 
                    action as secondary muscles. Lat pull-downs are effective for building a strong and well-defined back, improving 
                    shoulder strength and stability, and enhancing overall upper body muscular development. They are a fundamental 
                    exercise for anyone looking to target their back and improve their posture and upper body strength.

                     <p>
                        During curls, the primary muscles engaged are the biceps brachii, 
                        responsible for elbow flexion, with support from the brachialis, brachioradialis, 
                        and shoulder muscles. Forearm muscles also play a role in controlling wrist movement. 
                        Curls effectively build upper arm strength, enhance grip strength and wrist stability, 
                        and improve overall arm definition, making them a versatile and essential exercise for upper body fitness.
