            <h5>Bench Press</h5>
             <p>
                During a bench press, the primary muscles at work are the pectoralis major (chest muscles), 
                with support from the anterior deltoids and triceps. The upper back muscles also assist in maintaining proper posture. 
                Bench presses are excellent for building chest strength, shoulder stability, and overall upper body muscle development, 
                making them a fundamental exercise in strength training.
