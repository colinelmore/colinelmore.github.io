            <h5>Curls</h5>
             <p>
                During curls, the primary muscles engaged are the biceps brachii, 
                responsible for elbow flexion, with support from the brachialis, brachioradialis, 
                and shoulder muscles. Forearm muscles also play a role in controlling wrist movement. 
                Curls effectively build upper arm strength, enhance grip strength and wrist stability, 
                and improve overall arm definition, making them a versatile and essential exercise for upper body fitness.
