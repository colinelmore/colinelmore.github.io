      <p>Lifting weights has a very certain stigma surrounding it due to the negative outlook on lifting from the outside.
        Although, lifting heavy weights has a large array of benefits on current and lasting health.
        Working out routinely with heavy weights can cause your heart to be healthier, have a better control of blood sugar levels, as well as reverse the effects of Osteoporosis.
        While working out is still very healthy for you, adding weights in a healthy way can give your body the extra push to prevent more and stay healthier.

      <p>Visible change is the main reason people enjoy working out, but it is much deeper than that. Besides your overall bodily health.
        Working out boosts dopamine levels and can assist in the correction of a healthy sleep schedule. Seeing yourself change can make you happy for a split second,
        but feelings happier more consistently is an even better feeling. There are many myths to working out, such as it being damaging to your joints and people thinking they will get bulky.
